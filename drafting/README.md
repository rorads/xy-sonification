# Rabi Oscillation Sonification Project - Drafting Files Summary

This directory contains the development and experimental files for a project focused on sonifying Rabi oscillations. Here's a breakdown of each file's purpose:

## File Overview

- **audio_notebook.py** (161 lines): Contains code for audio processing and generation of Rabi oscillation sonifications, likely extracted from the Jupyter notebook.

- **strategies.py** (219 lines): Implements various sonification strategies for translating Rabi oscillation data into audio representations.

- **visualize.py** (114 lines): Provides visualization capabilities for Rabi oscillations, likely generating plots to complement the audio outputs.

- **utils.py** (75 lines): Contains utility functions used across the project for data manipulation and common operations.

- **cli.py** (56 lines): Implements a command-line interface for interacting with the sonification tools.

- **audio.ipynb** (22MB): A Jupyter notebook for interactive experimentation with audio generation and processing of Rabi oscillations. The large file size suggests it contains output data or embedded audio samples.

- **README.md** and **__init__.py**: Empty files (the README was likely intended for documentation).

- **__pycache__/**: Directory containing Python's compiled bytecode files.

## Note to Readers

Please be aware that these files represent the drafting and development phase of the project. They contain experimental code, prototypes, and works-in-progress. The finalized implementation and interactive experience can be found in the Streamlit dashboard, which offers a more polished and user-friendly interface for exploring Rabi oscillation sonifications.

The Streamlit dashboard provides the actual outputs, visualizations, and audio samples in an accessible format without requiring you to run these development scripts directly.
